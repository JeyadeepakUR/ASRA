    "Pod crash loop backoff (CrashLoopBackOff): Service fails to start. Runbook: Revert the deployment to the last known stable revision immediately. This typically indicates a missing environment variable or bad configuration in the manifest.",
    "Disk saturation on logging node: Elasticsearch/fluentd nodes running out of space. Runbook: Flush cache / delete old indices. If critical, scale volume limits or restart log ingestion pods to reset buffers.",
    "Network partition / unreachable nodes: Service cannot connect to DB or Redis. Runbook: This is a network-level event. No code actions (restart/rollback) will fix this. Reroute traffic to a healthy availability zone.",
